# Fake Data: {language} as spoken in {current_country} ({locale})

The basic concepts of fake data are described in
the [main tutorial](../fakedata.md#fake-data).

Our fake data can be localized to many languages. We have
[detailed docs](https://snowfakery.readthedocs.io/en/feature-fake-data-docs/locales.html)
about the other languages.

Current Locale: {locale} ({current_country})
