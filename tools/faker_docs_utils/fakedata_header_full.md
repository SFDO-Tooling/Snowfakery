# Fake data

##### Overview

Fake data comes in a few different flavours. Let's start with the
most common pattern:

```yaml
# examples/salesforce/simple_account.recipe.yml
- object: Account
  fields:
    Name:
      fake: Company
    Description:
      fake: CatchPhrase
    BillingStreet:
      fake: StreetAddress
    BillingCity:
      fake: City
    BillingState:
      fake: State
    BillingPostalCode:
      fake: PostalCode
    BillingCountry:
      fake: CurrentCountry
    Phone:
      fake: PhoneNumber
```

So the first obvious question is where you find these names. The answer
is you can scroll down on this page to see a long list with descriptions.

The description above might generate output like this:

```python
Account(id=1, Name=Nelson-Deleon, Description=Secured bandwidth-monitored moratorium, BillingStreet=2187 Kerry Way, BillingCity=Rangelland, BillingState=Colorado, BillingPostalCode=08388, BillingCountry=United States, Phone=001-738-530-9719)
```

It doesn't matter if you use upper or lower case for fake names.

##### Formulas

Sometimes you might want to combine the fake data with other data
in a single field. You can use formula syntaax for this.

```yaml
# examples/faker_in_formula.recipe.yml
- object: Account
  fields:
    Name: ${{fake.State}} State University
```

Some complex faker definitions can also use parameters. The
documentation says what parameters are allowed. The docs
for [fake: sentence](#fake-sentence) define `nb_words` and
`variable_nb_words`, for example.

```yaml
# examples/parameters.recipe.yml
- object: Example
  fields:
    gibberish_words: ${{fake.Sentence(nb_words=10, variable_nb_words=False)}}
```

##### Block fakers with parameters

If you'd rather not use the formula syntax (${{ blah }}) there is also
a nested syntax for that:

```yaml
# examples/parameters_block.recipe.yml
- object: Example
  fields:
    gibberish_words:
      fake.Sentence:
        nb_words: 10
        variable_nb_words: False
```

##### Localization

Our fake data can be localized to many languages. We have
[detailed docs](https://snowfakery.readthedocs.io/en/feature-fake-data-docs/locales.html)
about how to use fake data in each of the other languages.

The default locale is `en_US`: United Statesian Engish.

Let's say that you want to generate fake data for France instead of the
United States.

You do so by setting the special `snowfakery_locale` "variable" like this.

```yaml
# examples/salesforce/simple_account_french.recipe.yml

- var: snowfakery_locale
  value: fr_FR
- object: Account
  fields:
    Name:
      fake: Company
    Description:
      fake: CatchPhrase
    BillingStreet:
      fake: StreetAddress
    BillingCity:
      fake: City
    BillingState:
      fake: State
    BillingPostalCode:
      fake: PostalCode
    BillingCountry:
      fake: CurrentCountry
    Phone:
      fake: PhoneNumber
```

This will translate the State to the appropriate administrative unit in
France. `CurrentCountry` will be France, not `United States`. The Catch
Phrase will be in French and so forth.

For example:

```python
Account(id=1, Name=Parent Auger S.A.S., Description=Le confort de rouler de manière sûre, BillingStreet=54, rue de Bailly, BillingCity=Charrier, BillingState=Île-de-France, BillingPostalCode=72902, BillingCountry=France, Phone=08 05 11 90 19)
```

We can do many countries. For example, Japanese (ja_JP locale):

```python
Account(id=1, Name=有限会社山下電気, Description=Inverse 24hour pricing structure, BillingStreet=040 佐々木 Street, BillingCity=横浜市金沢区, BillingState=福岡県, BillingPostalCode=181-5538, BillingCountry=Japan, Phone=070-4156-5072)
```

We can even pick the locale randomly:

```yaml
# examples/salesforce/simple_account_random.recipe.yml
- var: snowfakery_locale
  value:
    random_choice:
      - ja_JP # Japanese
      - en_CA # Canadian English
      - fr_FR # French from France
      - fr_CA # Canadian French
      - de_DE # German from Germany
- object: Account
  fields:
    Name:
      fake: Company
    Description:
      fake: CatchPhrase
    BillingStreet:
      fake: StreetAddress
    BillingCity:
      fake: City
    BillingState:
      fake: State
    BillingPostalCode:
      fake: PostalCode
    BillingCountry:
      fake: CurrentCountry
    Phone:
      fake: PhoneNumber
```

##### Fake Dates and Numbers

The main Snowfakery documentation describes how to fake
[dates](index.md#date-between) and [numbers](index.md#random-number).

Datetimes are in UTC timezone by default:

```yaml
# examples/simple_datetime.recipe.yml
- object: Contact
  fields:
    FirstName:
      fake: FirstName
    LastName:
      fake: LastName
    EmailBouncedDate:
      fake: DateTime
```

Which might generate:

```python
Contact(id=1, FirstName=Shawn, LastName=Cole, EmailBouncedDate=1984-06-07T10:41:20+00:00)
```

Or you can use this more elaborate syntax to control the time-zone, start-date
and end-date:

```yaml
# examples/datetime_with_params.recipe.yml
- object: Contact
  fields:
    FirstName:
      fake: FirstName
    LastName:
      fake: LastName
    EmailBouncedDate:
      fake.datetime:
        start_date: -10y
        end_date: now
        timezone:
          relativedelta:
            hours: +8
```

Which generates data like:

```python
Contact(id=1, FirstName=Selena, LastName=Sampson, EmailBouncedDate=2012-10-09T21:56:17+08:00)
```

If you need a Datetime with no timezone, pass `False` as the timezone.

##### Custom Faker Providers

You can also include Faker extension libraries ("Providers") after
you’ve added them to your Python install:

```yaml
 - plugin: faker_microservice.Provider
 - object: OBJ
    fields:
    service_name:
        fake:
            microservice
```

You would install that provider like this:

```s
$ pip install faker_microservice
```

Here are some Python Faker providers:

<https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/communityproviders.html>

And you could make your own providers as well. Aaron Crosman
has written [a tutorial](https://spinningcode.org/2021/06/snowfakery-custom-plugins-part-2/)
about that process.
