# Snowfakery History

In the beginning, programmers created the databases. Now the databases were formless and empty, and they had no data.

And so [Salesforce.org](http://salesforce.org/) said “Let there be data,” and there was Snowfakery. And it was good.

## Snowfakery 1.3

`random_number` can now accept a "step" argument as descrbed in the docs.

The continuation file format changed. Do not upgrade Snowfakery while
running a long-running Snowfakery process. The new configuration file
should be less prone to issues relating to failures to serialize results.

The command line interface gives better error messages about unknown
file extensions.

Allow a short-form random_choice syntax that matches the docs.

The --target-number value now allows its two sub-arguments to be specified in either order: Tablename then number or number then tablename.

`date` now casts datetimes to dates instead of returning them unchanged.

## Snowfakery 1.2

Improvements to plugin API: add `evaluate_raw` and `simplify`

Dependency updates.

## Snowfakery 1.1.2

Minor improvements in error reporting.

Update to Faker 4.1.3

## Snowfakery 1.1.1

Fix a deployment problem relating to version.txt

## Snowfakery 1.1

Support for External Datasets. (PR #102)

Macros within Macros now work correctly. (PR #120)

It is now possible to have forward references to Nicknames. (PR #113)

Closed Issue #42: relating to relative month parsing

Closed Issue #131: Parse errors would result in an invalid rather than empty
JSON file.

Change the architecture to always initialize the database based on the recipe
and never do it from the CumulusCI Mapping file.

## Snowfakery 1.0.1

Update URLs for PyPI. No changes to the Snowfakery code itself.

## Snowfakery 1.0.0

Add child_index feature for calculating the index number of each child object (see documentation for more information).

Internal changes to support upcoming features in CumulusCI.

Documentation for the Math plugin.

Dates can now be parsed from strings with the `date()` function. (see docs)

Added `relativedelta()` function. (see docs)

Official formula syntax is now ${{foo}} instead of `<<foo>>`.
The old syntax will be supported for at least the remainder of 2020.

Docs are checked into Git in Markdown format.

Official terminology changed so that Snowfakery files are now called "recipes".

Stabilize the output order for CCI Mapping files generated by Snowfakery.

New syntax for Internalized fake data. (see docs)

Internally use the plugin architecture to support even the builtin functions.

## Snowfakery 0.8.1

Snowfakery includes support for Salesforce RecordTypes.

Snowfakery can output SQL/JSON NULL using YAML blank fields or the YAML literal 'null'

Fields starting with __ are now properly suppressed as per the documentation.

Various performance and reliability improvements:

* parsed dates are now cached
* Jinja values are always coerced to a string where appropriate
* internal attributes were renamed for clarity
* lookups are only generated in CCI mappings if they are actually needed

## Snowfakery 0.8.0

Snowfakery now specifies its install requirements with minimum versions rather than specific versions,
for improved compatibility with CumulusCI.

## Snowfakery 0.7

Windows compatibility improved, especially in test cases.

Changed the syntax for CSV handling.

Added --output-folder command.

## Snowfakery 0.6.1, 0.6.2, 0.6.3

Bugfixes (not user visible) and code cleanup.

## Snowfakery 0.6

Snowfakery 0.6 is open source!

## Snowfakery 0.5
