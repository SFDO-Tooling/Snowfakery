# Snowfakery Documentation

Snowfakery is a tool for generating fake data that has relations between tables. Every row is faked data, but also unique and random, like a snowflake.

To tell Snowfakery what data to generate, write a recipe file in YAML.

Snowfakery can write its output to `stdout`, or any database accessible to SQLAlchemy. _When it is embedded in CumulusCI, it can output to a Salesforce org._ Adding new output formats is a fairly straightforward process.

## Installation

### Installation for Salesforce Users

If you intend to use Snowfakery with Salesforce, we recommend installing CumulusCI, which includes Snowfakery in the installation. To install CumulusCI, follow the steps in the [Get Started](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html) section of the CumulusCI documentation. (Don't forget to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), too!)

After installation, use the `snowfakery` task command to invoke Snowfakery.

```s
$ snowfakery somefile.yml
...
```

### Installation for Non-Salesforce Users

If you are _not_ interested in using Snowfakery with Salesforce, directly install Snowfakery via [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/).

```s
$ pip3 install pipx
...
$ pipx install snowfakery
...
```

After installation, use the `snowfakery` task command to invoke Snowfakery.

```s
$ snowfakery somefile.yml
...
```

## Central Concepts

Snowfakery recipes are specified in the simple, human-readable [YAML](http://yaml.org/) format. A YAML file is designated by the `.yml` extension.

Let's start with a stupidly simple recipe named `simple_static.yml`. In this example, you can see that YAML uses indentation to define what parts of the file are related to each other.

```yaml
- object: Person
  fields:
    name: Buster Bluth
    age: 35
```

To create a record with this data, run the `snowfakery` task command with the recipe name.

```s
$ snowfakery docs/examples/simple_static.yml
...
```

This simple example generates a single record, a `Person` with three fields.

```python
Person(id=1, name=Buster Bluth, age=35)
```

Two of the fields, `name` and `age`, include data from the YAML file. The `id` field is auto-generated by Snowfakery.

| Field | id  | name         | age |
| ----- | --- | ------------ | --- |
| Value | 1   | Buster Bluth | 35  |

.. note::
Snowfakery only works for models that are amenable to including an `id` field for every record. Your tools can use the `id` column, ignore the `id` column, or exchange the `id` column for another kind of ID (like CumulusCI does with Salesforce), but Snowfakery always generates an ID for each record, and refers between tables with IDs. (Future versions are expected to include a command line option to turn this behavior on or off.)

Let's make a new recipe named `persons_of_interest.yml` that requires Snowfakery to do some automation.

```yaml
- object: Person
  count: 3
  fields:
    name:
      fake: name
    age:
      random_number:
        min: 12
        max: 95
```

Here's a breakdown for each step of this recipe.

- `object: Person`: Creates a record template for any rows generated in the `Person` table representing real-world `Person` objects.
- `count: 3`: Creates three `Person` records.
- `name: fake: name`: Generates a fake name for the `name` column instead of requiring you to manually enter one. The list of things you can fake is based on a library called Faker, which is discussed later in this documentation.
- `age: random_number`: Generates a random number between the `min` and the `max` values.

To run this recipe:

```s
$ snowfakery docs/examples/persons_of_interest.yml
...
```

Let's look at what this recipe (randomly) generates.

```python
Person(id=1, name=Allison Garcia, age=94)
Person(id=2, name=Megan Campos, age=67)
Person(id=3, name=Katherine Nelson, age=92)
```

We've created people! Or at least fake personas for people! And every time you run the recipe, you get a different set of "people".

While that's pretty cool, it doesn't use much of Snowfakery's power. Let's go deeper with a recipe named `pet_stories.yml`.

```yaml
- object: Person
  count: 3
  fields:
    name:
      fake: name
    age:
      random_number:
        min: 12
        max: 95
    dog:
      - object: Animal
        fields:
          name:
            fake: FirstName
          species: canine
          food:
            - object: PetFood
              fields:
                name: Pets Choice
                cost: $10

    cat:
      - object: Animal
        fields:
          name:
            fake: FirstName
          species: feline
          food:
            - object: PetFood
              fields:
                name: Pets Choice
                cost: $1
```

If you're lost, don't worry. There are a lot of new concepts in this recipe, so let's tackle them one by one. In this example:

- Three `Person` objects are created with the `count` function.
- Each `Person` has a `name`, an `age`, a `dog`, and a `cat`.
- Each `dog` or `cat` is an `Animal` row.
- If each `Person` has two animals, there are a total of six `Animal` objects.
- If each animal has a favorite food, there are a total of six `PetFood` objects.

To run this recipe:

```s
$ snowfakery docs/examples/pet_stories.yml
...
```

Here's a visual example of the output.

<img src='images/img1.png' id='PJUACATPCzI' alt='Relationship diagram' width='800' height='190'>

Later, we discuss how to create two `PetFood` objects that are shared, and how to generate a random value for `species` and `food`.

### Outputs

Snowfakery builds on a tool called SQLAlchemy, which provides a [variety of database connectors](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/dialects/index.html).

When integrated with CumulusCI, it's possible for Snowfakery to output to a Salesforce instance. To learn more about integration with CumulusCI, see [Advanced Features](#advanced-features).

Snowfakery can also output JSON, SQL, directories of CSV, and object diagrams. CSV output goes to a directory with one CSV file per table and a JSON manifest file in the [csvw](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-primer/) format.

This is a complete list of file-based (as opposed to database-based) formats.

- JSON: A custom JSON dialect
- TXT: A debugging-style output
- CSV: A directory of CSV files plus a csvw file
- SQL: A SQL file with `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements
- DOT: A graphviz file for use with the graphviz command line or [web-based](http://graphviz.it/) [tools](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline)
- SVG, SVGZ, JPEG, and PS PNG: Graphic formats that can be created if graphviz is installed

### Objects

The core concept of Snowfakery is an _object template_. The object template represents instructions on how to create a _row_ (or multiple rows) in a database. Rows, also known as _records_, in turn represent real-world entities such as people, places, or things, which is why we use the keyword `object`.

Each row has a type, a value that represents the name of the table that the row is added to in a relational database, or which CSV file the row is placed in. You declare the type after the keyword `object`.

As in an Object Relational system, think of objects or rows as synonyms. Rows are how we represent objects in tables or files. Records is another word synonymous with objects and rows in Salesforce.

Each row that is generated by Snowfakery is given a unique ID.

Let's revisit the `person_of_interest.yml` recipe.

```yaml
- object: Person
  count: 10
  fields:
    name:
      fake: name
    age:
      random_number:
        min: 12
        max: 95
```

These are the main properties of this Object Template.

- `object` is a type declaration that determines what table or file the row goes in.
- `count` determines how many rows are made. It can be randomized or computed using [Function Blocks](#function-blocks) or the [Formula Language](#formula-language).
- `fields` determine what data values to put in the row.

You can also have more than one Object Template for any row type, such as a relational table, CSV file, Salesforce Object, and so on.

Let's add a second `object` to the `person_of_interest.yml` recipe.

```yaml
- object: Person
  count: 3
  fields:
    name:
      fake: name
    age:
      random_number:
        min: 12
        max: 95
- object: Person
  count: 3
  fields:
    name:
      fake: name
    age:
      random_number:
        min: 0
        max: 12
```

Now there are six `Person` rows generated in the `Person` table (or file)--three between ages 0 and 12, and three between ages 12 and 95.

### Fake Data

To generate fake data with the `fake` function:

```yaml
- object: Account
  fields:
    Name:
      fake: Company
    Description:
      fake: CatchPhrase
    BillingStreet:
      fake: StreetAddress
    BillingCity:
      fake: City
    BillingState:
      fake: State
```

You can fake all sorts of data: names, addresses, Latin text, English sentences, URLs, and so much more. To see the complete list, along with other related features, see the [Fake Data Tutorial](fakedata.md)

### `friends`

To create a rule such as "For every `Person` created, create two `Animals`", use the `friends` feature.

```yaml
- object: Person
  count: 3
  fields:
    name:
      fake: name
    age:
      random_number:
        min: 12
        max: 95
  friends: # I get by with a little help from my...
    - object: Animal
      count: 2
      fields:
        name:
          fake: FirstName
```

This recipe outputs two animals per person.

```yaml
Person(id=1, name=Sierra Ortega, age=91)
Animal(id=1, name=Sarah)
Animal(id=2, name=Brian)
Person(id=2, name=Robert Haley, age=42)
Animal(id=3, name=Michele)
Animal(id=4, name=Jonathan)
Person(id=3, name=Jason White, age=35)
Animal(id=5, name=John)
Animal(id=6, name=Kimberly)
```

<img src='images/img2.png' id='PJUACAveFpc' alt='Relationship diagram' width='800' height='34'>

There is no explicit relationship between the animals and the people in this example, but sometimes you need an implicit "relationship" between the number of one object created and the number of the other.

You can also use this feature for [Many to One](#many-to-one-relationships).

### Relationships

Relationships are a big part of what separates Snowfakery from the dozens(!) of data generation tools out there.

Let's relate pets to their owners with ease in a recipe named `person_pet.yml`.

```yaml
- object: Person
  count: 3
  fields:
    name:
      fake: name
    pet:
      - object: Animal
        fields:
          name:
            fake: FirstName
          species: Petaurus Breviceps
```

Now each of the `Person` rows has a Sugar glider for a pet (which is a good thing, as long as they know how to take care of them).

Let's look at what this recipe (randomly) generates.

```python
Person(id=1, name=Rachel Thompson, pet=Animal(1))
Animal(id=2, name=Charles, species=Petaurus Breviceps)
Person(id=2, name=Alexander Zhang, pet=Animal(2))
Animal(id=3, name=Thomas, species=Petaurus Breviceps)
Person(id=3, name=Lisa King, pet=Animal(3))
```

<img src='images/img3.png' id='PJUACAooXkI' alt='Relationship Diagram'>

In addition, we can relate pets and owners "bidirectionally" with the `reference` feature.

Let's use the `reference` feature in a recipe named `secret_life_of_pets.yml`.

```yaml
# snowfakery/docs/examples/secret_life_of_pets.yml
- object: Person
  count: 3
  fields:
    name:
      fake: name
    pet:
      - object: Animal
        fields:
          name:
            fake: FirstName
          owner:
            reference: Person
```

Now `Person` has a `pet` field that refers to an `Animal` row. Each `Animal` row has an `owner` field that refers back to the `Person`row. It's called a bidirectional relationship--because it goes both ways. Of course, not all relationships are bi, but sometimes it's what your schema demands.

Let's look at what this recipe (randomly) generates.

```python
Animal(id=1, name=Nicole, owner=Person(1))
Person(id=1, name=Steven Ellis, pet=Animal(1))
Animal(id=2, name=Richard, owner=Person(2))
Person(id=2, name=Chad Delacruz, pet=Animal(2))
Animal(id=3, name=Tammie, owner=Person(3))
Person(id=3, name=Corey Zamora, pet=Animal(3))
```

<img src='images/img4.png' id='PJUACAKTd0o' alt='Relationship Diagram'>

The relationship from `Person` to `Animal` is called `pet`. It's expressed by embedding the Object Template for `Animal` in the field named `pet`.

The relationship from `Animal` to `Person` is called `owner`. It's expressed by the `reference` function. This function searches the YAML tree for the relevant `Person` row.

You can also use the `nickname` property to express a relationship between two rows that are not directly related in the hierarchy. For example, here's a recipe named `pet_stories_2.yml`.

```yaml
- object: PetFood
  nickname: petschoice
  fields:
    name: Pets Choice
    cost: $10

- object: PetFood
  nickname: vetschoice
  fields:
    name: Vets Choice
    cost: $12

- object: Person
  count: 3
  fields:
    name:
      fake: name
    dog:
      - object: Animal
        nickname: dog
        fields:
          owner:
            reference: Person
          name:
            fake: FirstName
          species: canine
          food:
            reference: petschoice

    cat:
      - object: Animal
        fields:
          owner: Person
          name:
            fake: FirstName
          species: feline
          nemesis: dog
          food:
            reference: vetschoice
```

Let's look at what this recipe (randomly) generates.

```perl
PetFood(id=1, name=Pets Choice, cost=$10)
PetFood(id=2, name=Vets Choice, cost=$12)
Animal(id=1, owner=Person, name=Dustin, species=canine, food=PetFood(1))
Animal(id=2, owner=Person, name=Edwin, species=feline, nemesis=dog, food=PetFood(2))
Person(id=1, name=Antonio Martin, dog=Animal(1), cat=Animal(2))
Animal(id=3, owner=Person, name=Kristy, species=canine, food=PetFood(1))
Animal(id=4, owner=Person, name=Bryan, species=feline, nemesis=dog, food=PetFood(2))
Person(id=2, name=Hunter Wright, dog=Animal(3), cat=Animal(4))
Animal(id=5, owner=Person, name=Gregory, species=canine, food=PetFood(1))
Animal(id=6, owner=Person, name=Veronica, species=feline, nemesis=dog, food=PetFood(2))
Person(id=3, name=Rebecca Williams, dog=Animal(5), cat=Animal(6))
```

<img src='images/img5.png' id='PJUACAJFf27' alt='Relationship Diagram' width='800' height='233'>

Funky!

The basic rule is that the last row (object) created with the nickname is the one that's referenced.

## Function Blocks

Fields can refer to functions that randomize, compute or look up data. You do that by nesting the function name under the field name, or with [formulas](#simple-formulas).

### `reference`

The `reference` function lets you look up another row (object) and make a reference to it. For example:

```yaml
- object: Animal
  fields:
    name:
      fake: FirstName
    owner:
      reference: Person
```

The `reference` function looks for another object by table name (`Person`, in this example), or a nicknamed object by `nickname`.

If an object is created earlier in the recipe, and it has the appropriate `nickname` or `tablename` property, that object is the target reference.

Otherwise, the reference can be to an object hasn't been created yet. Snowfakery generates an ID for the object so that the current row can be generated--only no other properties of this new object can be referred to, because it does not exist yet.

If the `reference` value contains periods, Snowfakery follows field names to get to the final name. The first name before the first "." can either be a field name or an object name.

```yaml
- object: cat
  nickname: Fluffy
  fields:
    color: black

- object: fiance
  nickname: sam
  fields:
    pet:
      reference: Fluffy

- object: betrothed
  fields:
    spouse:
      reference: sam
    pet:
      reference: spouse.pet
    color: ${{pet.color}}
```

Snowfakery (and CumulusCI) lets you loop over a recipe many times to generate multiple rows. In this case, a `reference` is always to an object created within the current iteration of a recipe. The exception to this rule are objects marked with the `just_once` property. These objects are created _only_ in the first iteration, and any references to them are solely to the objects created in that first iteration.

### `random_choice`

The `random_choice` function randomly chooses an option from a list.

```yaml
Payment_Method:
  random_choice:
    - Cash
    - Cheque
    - Credit Card
```

`random_choice` evens the odds of its random selection unless you enter specific odds as a percentage.

```yaml
StageName:
  random_choice:
    Closed Won: 60%
    In Progress: 20%
    New: 20%
```

To learn how to do more sophisticated randomness with features, read the [Random Weights That Are Not Percentages](#random-weights-that-are-not-percentages) section.

`random_choice` can also be used to randomly select potential child objects.

```yaml
- object: Task
  fields:
    person_doing_the_task:
      random_choice:
        - object: Contact
          fields:
            FirstName: Bart
            LastName: Simpson
        - object: Lead
          fields:
            FirstName: Marge
            LastName: Simpson
```

A more sophisticated syntax lets you combine probabilities with values that are more complex than simple strings.

Let's explore this syntax with a recipe named `random-choice-complex.yml`.

```yaml
# examples/random-choice-complex.yml
- object: Task
  count:
    random_choice:
      - choice:
          probability: 30%
          pick: 1
      - choice:
          probability: 30%
          pick: 3
      - choice:
          probability: 30%
          pick: 10
  fields:
    person_doing_the_task:
      random_choice:
        - choice:
            probability: 40%
            pick:
              - object: Contact
                fields:
                  FirstName: Bart
                  LastName: Simpson
        - choice:
            probability: 40%
            pick:
              - object: Contact
                fields:
                  FirstName: Marge
                  LastName: Simpson
        - choice:
            probability: 20%
            pick:
              - object: Contact
                fields:
                  FirstName: Lisa
                  LastName: Simpson
```

### `random_reference`

The `random_reference` property creates a reference to a random, existing row from a table.

```yaml
- object: Owner
  count: 10
  fields:
    name:
      fake: Name
- object: Pet
  count: 10
  fields:
    ownedBy:
      random_reference: Owner
```

The selected row can be any one that matches the object type and was already created in the current iteration of the recipe. For example, this previous recipe was executed twenty times (iterations) to generate 200 `Pets` and `Owners`. The selected rows in the first iteration would be one of the first ten `Owners`, and the selected rows in the last iteration would be one of the last ten.

Snowfakery cannot currently generate a random reference based on a nickname or to a row created in a previous or future iteration of the recipe. If you need these features, contact the Snowfakery team through a GitHub issue.

### `fake`

The `fake` function generates fake data. This function is defined further in the [Fake Data Tutorial](fakedata.md)

### `date_between`

The `date_between` function picks a random date in some date range. For example, this recipe picks a date between Y2K and the present day.

```yaml
- object: OBJ
    fields:
    date:
        date_between:
            start_date: 2000-01-01
            end_date: today
```

The options `start_date` and `end_date` can take these forms, too.

- `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `+<number>d`: `number` of days in the future, such as `+10d`
- `-<number>d`: `number` of days in the past, such as `-10d`
- `+<number>M`: `number` of months in the future, such as `+10M`
- `-<number>M`: `number` of months in the past, such as `-10M`
- `+<number>y`: `number` of years in the future, such as `+10y`
- `-<number>y`: `number` of years in the past, such as `-10y`
- `+<number>w`: `number` of weeks in the future, such as `+10w`
- `-<number>w`: `number` of weeks in the past, such as `-10w`
- `today`: The date the template is evaluated

Case _is_ relevant. The "M" for months is uppercase. The rest are lowercase.

Let's pick a date between 30 days ago and 108 days in the future.

```yaml
Payment_Date:
  date_between:
    start_date: -30d
    end_date: +180d
```

The `date_between` function can also be used in formulas.

```yaml
wedding_date: Our big day is ${{date_between(start_date="2022-01-31", end_date="2022-12-31")}}
```

### `random_number`

The `random_number` function picks a number in a range specified by `min` and `max`.

```yaml
age:
  random_number:
    min: 12
    max: 95
```

If the number has to be divsible by another number (such as only multiples of 10), supply a `step`.

```yaml
age:
  random_number:
    min: 10
    max: 90
    step: 10
```

As the name `step` implies, and to be a bit more precise, the output number minus `min` is a multiple of the `step`, which generates 12, 17 or 22.

```yaml
age:
  random_number:
    min: 12
    max: 23
    step: 5
```

The `random_number` function can also be used as a function in formulas.

```yaml
some_number: A number ${{random_number(min=5, max=10)}}
```

### `if` and `when`

`if` lets you make field values conditional on other field values.

`when` can be a Python formula. It's even interpreted as a boolean similar to how Python does it: the first `when` clause that matches is selected. The final `choice` clause in the sequence has no `when` clause; it's selected if there's no match to the previous choices.

Let's use `if` and `when` in a recipe named `conditional.yml`.

```yaml
# examples/conditional.yml
- object: Person
  fields:
    gender:
      random_choice:
        Male: 40%
        Female: 40%
        Other: 20%
    name:
      if:
        - choice:
            when: ${{gender=='Male'}}
            pick:
              fake: FirstNameMale

        - choice:
            when: ${{gender=='Female'}}
            pick:
              fake: FirstNameFemale

        - choice:
            pick:
              fake: FirstNameNonBinary
```

## Macros

Macros re-uses groups of fields instead of requiring you to repeat them manually.

Let's use a macro in a recipe named `evolution.yml`.

```yaml
- macro: canine
  fields:
    sound: barks
    legs: 4
    family: Caninae

- object: Animal
  include: canine
  fields:
    species: dog
    home: inside

- object: Animal
  include: canine
  fields:
    species: wolf
    home: outside
```

This recipe generates:

```yaml
Animal(id=1, sound=barks, legs=4.0, family=Caninae, species=dog, home=inside)
Animal(id=2, sound=barks, legs=4.0, family=Caninae, species=wolf, home=outside)
```

Let's include more than one group of macros in a recipe named `evolution_2.yml`.

```yaml
- macro: canine
  fields:
    sound: barks
    legs: 4
    family: Caninae

- macro: domestic
  fields:
    home: inside
    eats: petfood

- object: Animal
  count: 2
  include: canine, domestic
  fields:
    name: dog
```

This recipe generates:

```yaml
Animal(id=1, sound=barks, legs=4.0, family=Caninae, home=inside, eats=petfood, species=dog)
Animal(id=2, sound=barks, legs=4.0, family=Caninae, home=inside, eats=petfood, species=dog)
```

Macros can include other macros. In fact, macros are especially powerful if you combine them with the `include_file` feature that lets one file include another. We even suggest you make a library of the most common object types you work with and then override fields to combine or specialize them.

.. note::
`fields` or `friends` declared in the macros listed later override those listed earlier. `fields` or `friends` declared in the Object Template override those declared in macros.

## Define Variables

To generate a value shared by multiple templates, create a variable with `var`.

Let's create a variable named "lastname.yml" that uses a shared `var`.

```yaml
- var: lastname_var
  value:
    fake: LastName
- object: person
  fields:
    FirstName:
      fake: FirstName
    LastName: ${{lastname_var}}
- object: spouse
  fields:
    FirstName:
      fake: FirstName
    LastName: ${{lastname_var}}
```

.. note::
This works both at the top level of your recipe and in `friends` lists.

To group several fields together, create a "hidden" object.

```yaml
- var: shared_address
  value:
    - object: __shared_address
      fields:
        street:
          fake: StreetAddress
        city:
          fake: city
        state:
          fake: state
```

## Include Files

The `include_file` feature pulls in all declarations from the declared file. The file can itself include other files.

To include a file by a relative path:

```yaml
- include_file: child.yml
```

## Formulas

To insert data from one field into into another, use a formula.

```yaml
# examples/price_math.recipe.yml
- object: Sale
  fields:
    num_items:
      random_number:
        min: 10
        max: 20
    per_item_price:
      random_number:
        min: 10
        max: 20
    message: Thanks for buying ${{num_items}} items @ $${{per_item_price}} each!
```

You can also make your data more dynamic with formulas. Formulas even use the same functions described in [Function Blocks](#function-blocks), but they can also be used inline.

```yaml
- object: Sale
  count: 2
  fields:
    per_item_price: ${{random_number(20, 50)}}
    number_of_items: 3
    total: ${{per_item_price * number_of_items}}
    message: Thank you for buying $${{total}} items!
```

### Formula Language

Some general principles about formulas:

- Use `${{` to start a formula and `}}` to end it.
- Use Python expression syntax in the middle.
- Field values defined earlier on this object are available as names.
- Generate `fake` values in formulas with dots ("."). For example, `Name: ${{fake.FirstName}} Johnson`
- Parent (or ancestor) values are available through the parent's `object` name, such as `Opportunity.amount`.

Formulas are based on a similar language called Jinja2, but we use `${{` and `}}` to be more compatible with YAML.

The relevant section of the Jinja document is called [Expressions](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#expressions). It includes information about [Literals](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#literals), [Math](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#math), [Comparisons](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#comparisons), [Logic](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#logic), [Other Operators](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#other-operators), [If Expressions](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#if-expression) and [Python Methods](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#python-methods).

### Formula Functions and Variables

"Filters" allow you to do transformations of strings and numbers like this:

```yaml
# examples/jinja_filters.recipe.yml
- object: Campaign
  fields:
    Name: ${{fake.bs | title}} Campaign
    UpperCaseName: ${{fake.bs | upper}}
    LowerCaseName: ${{fake.bs | lower}}
```

The list of filters is in the [Jinja documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#list-of-builtin-filters).

### Formula Functions and Variables

The functions below are designed to be used in formulas.

#### `child_index`

The `child_index` function returns a counter of how many objects from this template were generated during the execution of the nearest parent template. It resets each time the parent template is executed.

```yaml
child_index: ${{child_index}}
```

#### `unique_id`

The `unique_id` variable returns a unique number that can
be used to distinguish any record from others. For example,
we can incorporate a unique ID into an email address or
an employee ID.

```yaml
# examples/unique_id/test_unique_id.yml
- object: Contact
  count: 3
  fields:
    FirstName:
      fake: FirstName
    LastName:
      fake: LastName
    EmployeeNum: ${{unique_id}}
    Email: ${{unique_id}}_${{fake.email}}
```

By default, Snowfakery works in "small id" mode, which means
that IDs start as 6-7 digits, and grow longer as you generate
more records.

```s
$ snowfakery examples/unique_id/test_unique_id.yml
Contact(id=1, FirstName=Melody, LastName=Sherman, EmployeeNum=1371010, Email=9782010_cowens@example.org)
Contact(id=2, FirstName=Christian, LastName=Owens, EmployeeNum=2433010, Email=2414010_jimmy21@example.com)
Contact(id=3, FirstName=Tami, LastName=Stevenson, EmployeeNum=6375010, Email=8126010_leah50@example.net)
...
```

"Big ID" mode allows you to make 22+ digit IDs that are very likely to
be unique across time and space. It is
described more in [`unique_id` and Big IDs](#unique_id-and-big-ids).

Snowfakery may change its default mode to Big IDs at some point in the future.
Do not assume that your IDs will always be small.

If you do not care about uniqueness, use `random_number` instead.

If you want the numbers to be generated in
a predictable fashion with no gaps, use
[`counter`](#counter) instead.

If you want the numbers to have a certain
number of digits, use the `UniqueId` plugin.

#### `unique_alpha_code`

The `unique_alpha_code` functions generates unique alphanumeric codes similar to those
used in some bureaucracies were space is an issue. Snowfakery alphanumeric codes are
about 11 characters long in small ID mode and about 17 in Big ID mode. The more you use,
the bigger they will grow.

```yaml
# examples/unique_id/test_unique_alpha_code.yml
- object: Contact
  count: 3
  fields:
    FirstName:
      fake: FirstName
    LastName:
      fake: LastName
    DepartmentCode: ${{unique_alpha_code}}
```

```s
Contact(id=1, FirstName=Jeremy, LastName=Higgins, DepartmentCode=2AUHHSZN)
Contact(id=2, FirstName=Vicki, LastName=Vazquez, DepartmentCode=GDH9OYLN)
Contact(id=3, FirstName=Gene, LastName=Wall, DepartmentCode=42Q3XX3N)
```

#### `today`

The `today` variable returns a date representing the current date. This date does not change chanage during the execution of a single recipe.

#### `fake:` and `fake.`

The `fake:` block function and `fake.` namespace both generate fake data as described in the [Fake Data Tutorial](fakedata.md).

Let's use `fake:` and `fake.` in a recipe named `two_fakers.yml`.

```yaml
# examples/two_fakers.yml
- object: Contact
  fields:
    FirstName:
      fake: FirstName
    LastName: ${{fake.LastName}}
```

#### `snowfakery_filename`

The `snowfakery_filename` variable represents the file that contains the template. This is useful for relative paths.

#### `date`

The `date` function can coerce a string into a date object for calculations, or generate a new date object from year/month/day designations. For example:

```yaml
the_date: ${{date("2018-10-30")}}
another_date: ${{date(year=2018, month=11, day=30)}}
```

#### `relativedelta`

The [`relativedelta` function](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/relativedelta.html) from `dateutil` is available for use in calculations. For example:

```yaml
${{ date(Date_Established__c) + relativedelta(months=child_index) }}
```

Some plugins are also interested in a `template` variable that has an `id` attribute that represents a unique identifier for the current template. Look at
[datasets.py](https://github.com/SFDO-Tooling/Snowfakery/blob/main/snowfakery/standard_plugins/datasets.py) to see one use-case where the template's ID can used to differentiate between two otherwise identical datasets.

#### `NULL`

The `NULL` value represents a missing value.

Let's use this value in a recipe named `nullvalue.yml`.

```yaml
- object: foo
  count: 10
  fields:
    EndDate:
      random_choice:
        - date_between:
            start_date: 2018-01-01
            end_date: 2021-12-12
        - NULL
    DateSupplied:
      if:
        - choice:
            when: ${{ EndDate!=NULL }}
            pick: "Yes"
        - choice:
            pick: "No"
```

In this example, `NULL` becomes a `random_choice` option in the `EndDate` field. Then in the `DateSupplied` field, you test if the value is `NULL` or not.

## Command Line Interface

Use the command line interface to learn the list of options available in the latest version of Snowfakery.

```s
Usage: snowfakery [OPTIONS] YAML_FILE

      Generates records from a YAML file

      Records can go to:

```

### Scale Up Recipe Execution

From the command line you can control how many rows a recipe generates.

The simplest method:

```s
snowfakery accounts.yml --reps 1000
```

This runs the recipe 1000 times. Easy!

But let's say you want to run a test against 50,000 accounts. You can calculate out how many `reps` to run in the command line, but this can be complex because Snowfakery recipes can also generate a random number of accounts in each run. Even for simple recipes, doing the math can be a headache, especially if you frequently make edits to the recipe.

A better solution is to specify the `target-number` and `target tablename`. For example:

```s
snowfakery accounts.yml --target-number 1000 Account
```

The count works like this:

- Snowfakery always executes a _complete_ recipe. It never stops halfway through.
- At the end of recipe execution, Snowfakery checks if it created enough of the object type defined by `target-number`.
- If so, Snowfakery finishes the recipe. If not, it runs the recipe again.

If your recipe creates 10 Accounts, 5 Contacts and 15 Opportunities, and the previous command runs the recipe 100 times (1000/10=100), it generates 1000 Accounts, 500 Contacts, and 1500 Opportunites.

### CSV Output

To create a CSV directory:

```s
$ snowfakery template.yml --output-format csv --output-folder csvfiles
...
```

This generates a directory that looks like:

```s
Animal.csv
Person.csv
PetFood.csv
csvw_metadata.json
```

.. note::
If you do not specify an `output-folder`, the files are created in the current folder.

The [CSVW](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-primer/) JSON file is a sort of manifest for all of the CSV files.

## Advanced Features

### Singletons with the `just_once` Feature

Snowfakery scales up to larger data volumes by evaluating your recipe over and over again. Each evaluation is called an `iteration`.

Some objects are meant to be produced only once, regardless of how many times the recipe executes. The programming language term for this is a "singleton". For example, an accounting system generates a dataset that has exactly two `Ledger` objects, `Checking` and `Savings`. You can have dozens of `Entries` per `Ledger`, or even billions. But the recipe only generates two `Ledger` rows.

Let's generate two--and only two!--`Ledger` rows with the `just_once` function in a recipe named `twoledgers.yml`.

```yaml
- object: Ledger
  just_once: True
  nickname: Checking
  fields:
    Name: Checking

- object: Ledger
  just_once: True
  nickname: Savings
  fields:
    Name: Savings

- object: Entry
  count: 1000
  fields:
    Ledger: Checking
    ...

- object: Entry
  count: 1000
  fields:
    Ledger: Savings
    ...
```

To execute this recipe from the Snowfakery command line:

```s
$ snowfakery accounting.yml --target-number 10_000 Entry
...
```

This recipe creates two `Ledger` rows, and 5000 `Entry` rows attached to each of the `Ledger` rows. If you scale up the recipe to one million, you still have only two `Ledger` rows.

### Hidden Fields and Objects

As described earlier, fields can refer to each other. For example, field `c` can be the sum of fields `a` and `b`. Or perhaps you only want to output `PersonLastName` if `PersonFirstName` was set, and `PersonFirstName` is set randomly.

To create a value that gets used in computations but does _not_ become output in the final database or CSV, create a field value prefixed by two underscores.

You can even do this with Object Templates to generate "objects" that are never saved as rows to your database, Salesforce org, or output file.

Let's hide several fields and objects in a recipe named `hidden_fields.yml`.

```yaml
- object: Dates
  fields:
    __total_months: 48
    __first_month: ${{today - relativedelta(months=__total_months)}}
    __end_of_first_quarter: ${{date(__first_month) + relativedelta(months=3)}}
    ProgramStartDate: ${{__first_month}}
    FirstEvent:
      date_between:
        start_date: ${{__first_month}}
        end_date: ${{__end_of_first_quarter}}
    ProgramEndDate: ${{date(__first_month) + relativedelta(months=12)}}
```

This generates:

```json
Dates(id=1, ProgramStartDate=2016-11-30, FirstEvent=2017-02-24, ProgramEndDate=2017-11-30)
```

### Random Weights that are Not Percentages

Consider this field definition.

```yaml
StageName:
  random_choice:
    Closed Won: 5
    In Progress: 3
    New: 4
```

Observant readers note that the values do not add up to 100. That's fine. `Closed Won` is selected 5/12 of the time, `In Progress` is selected 3/12, and `New` is selected 4/12 of the time. They are just weights, not necessarily percentage weights.

### Many to One Relationships

In relational databases, child records typically have a reference to their parent record, but the opposite is not true.

Let's examine the relationships featured in the recipe named `company.yml`. You see that the `Company` object (row) relates to many `Employee` objects (rows).

```yaml
# examples/company.yml
- object: Company
  fields:
    Name:
      fake: company

- object: Employee
  nickname: Employee 1
  fields:
    Name:
      fake: name
    EmployedBy:
      - object: Company

- object: Employee
  nickname: Employee 1
  fields:
    Name:
      fake: name
    EmployedBy:
      - object: Company
```

This generates:

```javascript
Company(id=1, Name=Nelson-Sampson)
Company(id=2)
Employee(id=1, Name=Julie Turner, EmployedBy=Company(2))
Company(id=3)
Employee(id=2, Name=Amanda Martin, EmployedBy=Company(3))
```

Now let's say you generate 10 companies with 100 employees per company. It's easy with Snowfakery's `friends` or `hidden field` feature.

Let's use the `friends` feature in a recipe named `company2.yml`.

```yaml
# examples/company2.yml
- object: Company
  count: 10
  fields:
    Name:
      fake: company
  friends:
    - object: Employee
      count: 100
      nickname: Employee 1
      fields:
        Name:
          fake: name
        EmployedBy:
          reference: Company
```

And let's use the `hidden fields`([#hidden-fields-and-objects]) feature in a recipe named `company3.yml`.

```yaml
# examples/company3.yml
- object: Company
  count: 10
  fields:
    Name:
      fake: company
    __employees:
      - object: Employee
        count: 100
        nickname: Employee 1
        fields:
          Name:
            fake: name
          EmployedBy:
            reference: Company
```

### Advanced Unique ID Generators

Snowfakery has two built-in functions for generating UniqueIDs plus the more advanced
objects described below. The simple functions are [`unique_id`](#unique_id) and
[`unique_alpha_code`](#unique_alpha_code). More advanced generators ID generators
can also be created.

#### `unique_id` and Big IDs

Snowfakery's default mode for ID generation is "Small ID" mode, wherein IDs start out as single-digit numbers and grow over time.

"Big ID" mode allows you to make IDs that are very likely to
be unique across time and space. Specifically: it incorporates
a timestamp, information about the current process and about
8 bits of randomness. The generated IDs are about 22 digits
long. Unless you are running Snowfakery on
thousands of computers at the exact same time, the chances of a clash are
miniscule, and in any case, a clash only matters if the unique IDs are
destined to end up in a common Salesforce Org or database.

CumulusCI manages Big ID mode for you automatically.

If you are using Snowfakery outside of CumulusCI, you can turn on Big ID
mode from the command line:

```s
$ snowfakery examples/test_unique_id.yml --plugin-option big_ids True
Contact(id=1, FirstName=Stephen, LastName=Parrish, Employee=763534209134265915391, Email=763534209134265915392_brittany17@example.org)
```

If you do need even higher levels of uniqueness, you can
inject "unique execution ids" from some external source through the
plugin option `pid`. Those execution
ids would replace the timestamp and process information in your Big ID's calculation.

```s
 $ snowfakery examples/test_unique_id.yml --plugin-option big_ids True --plugin-option pid 111
Contact(id=1, FirstName=Melody, LastName=Marquez, Employee=157937691, Email=157937692_emmahoover@example.org)
```

The `111` value is not literally included in the ID, but it is an input into
the unique ID generation algorithm. As an example, you can inject
about 15 digits of randomness and a timestamp like this on Unix-ish systems:

```s
snowfakery examples/test_unique_id.yml --plugin-option big_ids True --plugin-option pid `date +"%s"`$RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM
Contact(id=1, FirstName=Cheryl, LastName=Estes, Employee=11014765223046647500920591, Email=11014765223046647500920592_solisroy@example.org)
```

If you pause and resume Snowfakery recipe generation using the continuation
file feature, indexes will restart, so you should inject an external unique
context ID through `pid` as shown above or through the API.

### Counters

Snowfakery has a plugin called `Counters` which can generate
numeric counters (1,2,3,4 or 3,6,9,12) and date counters
(2021-01-01, 2021-01-02, 2021-01-03).

Counters are reset
every iteration of the recipe.
Counters are reset at the beginning of every "iteration". This makes them
inappropriate for generating unique identifiers. Use [`unique_id`](#unique_id)
instead.

#### Numeric Counters

Snowfakery can generate incrementing numbers like this:

```yaml
# examples/counters/number_counter.recipe.yml
- plugin: snowfakery.standard_plugins.Counters
- object: Example
  count: 10
  fields:
    count:
      Counters.NumberCounter:
        start: 1
        name: foo
```

This would output:

```s
$ snowfakery examples/counters/number_counter.recipe.yml
Example(id=1, count=1)
Example(id=2, count=2)
Example(id=3, count=3)
Example(id=4, count=4)
Example(id=5, count=5)
Example(id=6, count=6)
Example(id=7, count=7)
Example(id=8, count=8)
Example(id=9, count=9)
Example(id=10, count=10)
```

You can also control the start position and "step" like this:

```yaml
# examples/counters/counter_start.recipe.yml
- plugin: snowfakery.standard_plugins.Counters
- object: Example
  count: 10
  fields:
    count:
      Counters.NumberCounter:
        start: 11
        step: 3
```

This generates:

```s
Example(id=1, count=11)
Example(id=2, count=14)
Example(id=3, count=17)
Example(id=4, count=20)
Example(id=5, count=23)
Example(id=6, count=26)
Example(id=7, count=29)
Example(id=8, count=32)
Example(id=9, count=35)
Example(id=10, count=38)
```

As described above, counters are reset each iteration, as described above:

```s
snowfakery examples/counters/number_counter.recipe.yml --reps 2
Example(id=1, count=1)
Example(id=2, count=2)
Example(id=3, count=3)
Example(id=4, count=4)
Example(id=5, count=5)
Example(id=6, count=6)
Example(id=7, count=7)
Example(id=8, count=8)
Example(id=9, count=9)
Example(id=10, count=10)
Example(id=11, count=1)
Example(id=12, count=2)
Example(id=13, count=3)
Example(id=14, count=4)
Example(id=15, count=5)
Example(id=16, count=6)
Example(id=17, count=7)
Example(id=18, count=8)
Example(id=19, count=9)
Example(id=20, count=10)
```

#### Date Counters for Schedules

Snowfakery can generate incrementing numbers like this:

```yaml
# examples/counters/simple_date_counter.recipe.yml
- plugin: snowfakery.standard_plugins.Counters
- var: EveryTwoWeeks
  value:
    Counters.DateCounter:
      start_date: 2021-01-01
      step: +2w
- object: Meetings
  count: 4
  fields:
    Date: ${{EveryTwoWeeks.next}}
    Topic:
      fake: catchphrase
```

This generates:

```json
Meetings(id=1, Date=2021-01-01, Topic=Innovative dedicated solution)
Meetings(id=2, Date=2021-01-15, Topic=Open-architected tangible artificial intelligence)
Meetings(id=3, Date=2021-01-29, Topic=Compatible global definition)
Meetings(id=4, Date=2021-02-12, Topic=Optimized real-time archive)
```

The `start_date` can be a particular date in `YYYY-MM-DD` or the word `today`.

The `step` is based on a syntax from the Python Faker library. It can be:

- `+<number>d` : `number` days between steps, e.g. `+10d` (10 days)
- `+<number>w`: `number` weeks between steps, e.g. `+10w` (70 days)
- `+<number>M`: `number` months between steps, e.g. `+10M` (304 days)
- `+<number>y`: `number` years between steps, e.g. `+10y` (3625 days)

### Recipe Options

Instead of manually entering the exact number of records to create into a template file, pass an `option` (such as numbers, strings, booleans, and so on) to your generator recipe from the command line.

First, declare the `option` in your template file. For example:

```yaml
- option: num_accounts
  default: 10
```

.. note::
If you do not specify a `default`, the `option` itself becomes mandatory, and the template is not processed without it.

To use an `option` value by referring to it in a formula:

```yaml
- object: Account
  count: ${{num_accounts}}
```

Of course, you can do any math you want in the formula...

```yaml
- object: Account
  count: ${{num_accounts / 2}}
    field:
        type: A
- object: Account
  count: ${{num_accounts / 2}}
    field:
        type: B
```

...Then pass that option.

```yaml
--option numaccounts 10
```

### Use Snowfakery in Python

You can embed Snowfakery in a Python application.

```python
from snowfakery import generate_data

generate_data(
    yaml_file="examples/company.yml",
    option=[("A", "B")],
    target_number=(20, "Employee"),
    debug_internals=True,
    output_format="json",
    output_file=outfile,
)
```

To learn more about using Snowfakery in Python, see [Embedding Snowfakery into Python Applications](./embedding.md)

### Use Snowfakery with Databases

Snowfakery is built on top of a very flexible engine called SQLAlchemy. This engine lets it connect to many different databases subject to the limitations described in this section.

First, install Snowfakery in a context that makes it easy to use the Python command `pip` to manage your Python environment. For example, you can install Python
using the standard installers from `python.org`, and then run these commands to create and use a `venv` with the Postgres package.

```bash

# create a new directory for our experiment
$ mkdir experiment_with_postgres
# cd into it
$ cd experiment_with_postgres
# create a new database:
# https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/app-createdb.html
$ createdb snowfakerydb
# create a virtual environment. A good habit to get into.
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
$ python3 -m venv myvenv
# activate the venv
$ source myvenv/bin/activate
# install Snowfakery in this venv
$ pip install snowfakery
# install the Postgres library for Python
# https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/
$ pip install psycopg2
# let's use it!
$ snowfakery --dburl='postgresql://localhost:5432/snowfakerydb' ~/code/Snowfakery/examples/company.yml --target-number 1000 Employee
# and check the results
# https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/app-psql.html
$ echo 'select * from "Employee"' | psql snowfakerydb
```

A limitation of this process is that Snowfakery currently can only create new tables rather than import into existing ones. The table has an `id` column in addition to columns for every field that was generated by the recipe. All columns are type `text`.

The list of databases supported by our underlying infrastructure (SQLAlchemy) is listed [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html#supported-databases) and [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/dialects/index.html).

Snowfakery is not proactively tested with every output database. We encourage you to keep in touch with the Snowfakery team about your experience of using Snowfakery with your databases. It gives us a better sense of what works well and what does not. We also appreciate any bug reports and pull requests related to problems you discover along the way.

### Plugins and Providers

Plugins and providers extend Snowfakery with Python code. A plugin adds new functions to Snowfakery. A provider adds new capabilities to the Faker library, which is exposed to Snowfakery users through the `fake:` keyword.

To include plugins or providers in a Snowfakery file:

```yaml
- plugin: package.module.classname
```

### Built-in Plugins

#### Advanced Math

Snowfakery has a `Math` plugin that offers access to all features from Python's [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html), [`min`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min), [`max`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max), and [`round`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round).

For example:

```yaml
- plugin: snowfakery.standard_plugins.Math
- object: OBJ
  fields:
    twelve:
      Math.sqrt: ${{Math.min(144, 169)}}
```

Or:

```yaml
- plugin: snowfakery.standard_plugins.Math
- object: OBJ
  fields:
    twelve: ${Math.sqrt}
```

### Advanced Unique IDs with the UniqueId plugin

There is a plugin which gives you more control over the generation of
Unique IDs and Alphanumeric Codes.

#### Unique ID Alphabets

One of the features of the UniqueId plugin is controlling the alphabet
used for generating alphanumeric codes. One could make the alphabet
bigger or smaller as below:

```yaml
# examples/unique_id/alphabet.recipe.yml
- plugin: snowfakery.standard_plugins.UniqueId
- var: LargeAlphabetGenerator
  value:
    UniqueId.AlphaCodeGenerator:
      alphabet: 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
- var: DNAGenerator
  value:
    UniqueId.AlphaCodeGenerator:
      alphabet: ACGT
- var: NumberGenerator
  value:
    UniqueId.AlphaCodeGenerator:
      alphabet: 0123456789

- object: DemonstrateAlphabets
  count: 5
  fields:
    big_alpha_example: ${{LargeAlphabetGenerator.unique_id}}
    dna_example: ${{DNAGenerator.unique_id}}
    num_example: ${{NumberGenerator.unique_id}}
```

This would generate:

```s
DemonstrateAlphabets(id=1, big_alpha_example=2r0NXGiBY, dna_example=GACGCCCTACCA, num_example=6843813157)
DemonstrateAlphabets(id=2, big_alpha_example=4LTepQ9TE, dna_example=TGTGTTTTTATGA, num_example=56465396322)
DemonstrateAlphabets(id=3, big_alpha_example=2yRu7l5Rk, dna_example=TGTCTGGTCTTA, num_example=22377438298)
DemonstrateAlphabets(id=4, big_alpha_example=1WCE6hDIO, dna_example=TGGTTTGTTAGA, num_example=22299878992)
DemonstrateAlphabets(id=5, big_alpha_example=1I25wfsXE, dna_example=GCGTGTCGTATTA, num_example=39979614438)
```

#### Code length

You can control the minimum (but not the maximum) length of a unique code:

```yaml
# examples/unique_id/min_length.recipe.yml
- plugin: snowfakery.standard_plugins.UniqueId
- var: MySmallCodeGenerator
  value:
    UniqueId.AlphaCodeGenerator:
      min_chars: 6
- object: Example
  count: 10
  fields:
    unique: ${{MySmallCodeGenerator.unique_id}}
```

The code will grow over time as a consequence of keeping every value unique.

### External datasets

Snowfakery can incorporate data from external CSV files or databases as datasets.

#### Iterate Over CSV Datasets

Here's an example of a simple CSV-based dataset named `addresses.csv`. Note that the column names come from the first row.

```text
Number,Street,City,Postcode
420,Kings Ave,Burnaby,85633
421,Granville Street,White Rock,85633
422,Kingsway Road,Richmond,85633
```

To iterate over this data with Snowfakery:

```yaml
- plugin: snowfakery.standard_plugins.datasets.Dataset
- object: Person
  count: 10
  fields:
    Name:
      fake: name

    __address_from_csv:
      Dataset.iterate:
        dataset: addresses.csv
    StreetAddress: ${{__address_from_csv.Number}} ${{__address_from_csv.Street}}
    City: ${{__address_from_csv.City}}
```

`examples/datasets/datasets.recipe.yml`

The plugin only needs to be declared once per recipe.

The double-underscore ("dunder") syntax is described in [#hidden-fields-and-objects].
In this context, it grabs an entire CSV row and gives it a name so that specific columns can later be called by that name.

The `Dataset.iterate` [function block](#function-blocks) pulls each row from the dataset in order, one for each `Person`. It returns to the top after it has used every row.

Let's look at what this dataset (randomly) generates.

```s
$ snowfakery examples/datasets/datasets.recipe.yml
Person(id=1, Name=Dawn Gray, StreetAddress=420 Kings Ave, City=Burnaby)
Person(id=2, Name=Melissa Walker, StreetAddress=421 Granville Street, City=White Rock)
Person(id=3, Name=Roberto Simon, StreetAddress=422 Kingsway Road, City=Richmond)
Person(id=4, Name=Miss Jessica Ramsey, StreetAddress=420 Kings Ave, City=Burnaby)
Person(id=5, Name=Bobby Sutton, StreetAddress=421 Granville Street, City=White Rock)
Person(id=6, Name=Tiffany Cox, StreetAddress=422 Kingsway Road, City=Richmond)
Person(id=7, Name=Ethan Potts, StreetAddress=420 Kings Ave, City=Burnaby)
Person(id=8, Name=Tamara Farley, StreetAddress=421 Granville Street, City=White Rock)
Person(id=9, Name=Austin Wong, StreetAddress=422 Kingsway Road, City=Richmond)
Person(id=10, Name=Kelly Jones, StreetAddress=420 Kings Ave, City=Burnaby)
```

You can use this feature to create "enriched" data by combining real or pre-generated data in a CSV file with fake data from Snowfakery.

You can execute a template exactly once for every line in a
CSV file (or database table, or Salesforce Query) using the
`for_each` keyword:

```yaml
# examples/datasets/simple_for_each.yml
- plugin: snowfakery.standard_plugins.datasets.Dataset

- object: Person
  for_each:
    var: current_address
    value:
      Dataset.iterate:
        dataset: addresses.csv
  fields:
    FirstName:
      fake: FirstName
    LastName:
      fake: LastName
    StreetAddress: ${{current_address.Number}} ${{current_address.Street}}
    City: ${{current_address.City}}
```

This binds a new row from the CSV to the variable named `current_address`
over and over, expanding the template for each row. The `for_each` replaces
the `count` in a template that uses it.

#### Iterate over Salesforce Datasets

CumulusCI can be used to download CSV data for enrichment.

Let's download CSV data in a recipe named `CumulusCI.yml`.

```yaml
contacts_for_accounts:
  steps:
    1:
      task: query
      options:
        object: Account
        query: select Id from Account
        result_file: accounts.csv
    2:
      task: generate_and_load_from_yaml
      options:
        generator_yaml: examples/salesforce/ContactsForAccounts.recipe.yml
        num_records: 100
        num_records_tablename: Contact
```

As you can see, `CumulusCI.yml` uses the `generate_and_load_from_yaml` task to parse data from the recipe named `ContactsForAccounts.recipe.yml`.

```yaml
- plugin: snowfakery.standard_plugins.datasets.Dataset
- object: Contact
  fields:
    __accounts:
      Dataset.shuffle:
        dataset: ../../accounts.csv
    FirstName:
      fake: FirstName
    LastName:
      fake: LastName
    AccountId: ${{__accounts.Id}}
```

Of course, adjust the paths based on your directory structure.

It's a matter of time until Snowfakery has built-in features to query SOQL, so we recommend that you evaluate those features as an alternative to this technique.

#### Iterate over SQL Database Datasets

If the reference to a dataset is a URL, Snowfakery attempts to use it as a reference to a database. Snowfakery supports `sqlite:///` urls as described in the documentation for [SQL Alchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html#sqlite).

That looks exactly like above except for this line.

```yaml
dataset: sqlite:///addresses.db
```

Depending on the context, other database URLs work as well _if_ the context has appropriate drivers installed. Only SQLite is part of our test suite, however.

If a SQL dataset has more than one table, specify what table to use. For example:

```yaml
__address_from_csv:
  Dataset.iterate:
    dataset: addresses.csv
    table: addresses
```

#### Shuffle Data

If you prefer the rows be pulled out in random order, you have two options. The simplest thing is to shuffle it in your Snowfakery recipe.

```yaml
__address_from_csv:
  Dataset.shuffle:
    dataset: addresses.csv
```

If you experience performance or memory usage problems with big datasets, your next option is to shuffle the data into a random order _before_ using it in Snowfakery. Snowfakery's source repository includes a simplistic tool called `shufflecsv.py` that shuffles data for CSV files. You feed it a CSV file on `stdin`, and it generates another CSV file on `stdout`.

To shuffle data with `shufflecsv.py` in the command line:

```s
$ python tools/shufflecsv.py < examples/datasets/addresses.csv > examples/datasets/shuffled.csv
...
```

.. note::
This script does not currently support CSVs that include newlines within fields.

To shuffle for SQLite or another database, write a script that uses the clause `order by random()`. This is also how Snowfakery does its randomization internally, so there's not much incentive to only run the Snowfakery recipe once. However, it can save you time if you run the Snowfakery recipe over and over because the shuffling happens once.

### Read Files

To read and include Unicode files:

```yaml
- plugin: snowfakery.standard_plugins.file.File

- object: TextData
  fields:
    encoded_data:
      - File.file_data:
          encoding: utf-8
          file: ../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
```

`utf-8` is the default encoding, so you don't actually need to declare it here. That said, other popular text encodings include `ascii`, `big5`, `latin-1` and `shift_jis`. There's even more encodings featured on the [100 encodings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings) list.

To read and include Binary files:

```yaml
- plugin: snowfakery.standard_plugins.base64.Base64
- plugin: snowfakery.standard_plugins.file.File

- object: BinaryData
  fields:
    encoded_data:
      Base64.encode:
        - File.file_data:
            encoding: binary
            file: salesforce/example.pdf
```

Other encodings of binary data are not currently supported, and output streams generally don't support raw binary data being written to them. It is relatively easy to make a plugin that does other encodings by building on the code in [`File.py`](https://github.com/SFDO-Tooling/Snowfakery/blob/main/snowfakery/standard_plugins/file.py).

### Custom Plugins and Providers

Snowfakery can be extended with custom plugins and fake data providers as described in [Extending Snowfakery with Python Code](./extending.md).

## Use Snowfakery with Salesforce

Snowfakery recipes that generate Salesforce records are like any other Snowfakery recipes, but instead use `SObject` names for the `objects`. There are several examples [in the Snowfakery repository](https://github.com/SFDO-Tooling/Snowfakery/tree/main/examples/salesforce).

Salesforce-specific patterns and tools are described in [Use Snowfakery with Salesforce](salesforce.md)

## Appendices

### Snowfakery Glossary

- Object: A type of data, or in this case a row of data, that represents real-world entities like people, places, or things. See also: Rows.
- Object Template: Instructions on how to create a row, or multiple rows, in a database. Each row represents a real-world object.
- Rows: A unit of related information to an object listed in a database, often called records. For example, in Salesforce (which includes a database) a `Contact` record has a first name, last name, phone number, and so on. In a database each `Contact` is listed as a separate row. `Contact` is the object type of each of those rows, and rows represent real-world objects. See also: Objects.
- Recipe: A Snowfakery YAML file that instructs Snowfakery on what to generate.
- Iteration: Snowfakery recipes can be "scaled up" to generate more data when executed over and over again. These executions are called iterations.
- Singleton: A singleton is an Object Template that generates a single row regardless of how many times the recipe is iterated.
- YAML: A relatively simple, human-readable format. Learn more at [yaml.org](http://yaml.org/).

### Appendix: Security Profile of Snowfakery

Snowfakery is a domain-specific programming language with access to most of the power of Python. It can load Python plugins and call Python methods. It's unwise to run untrusted recipes in an environment that has access to secure resources, such as passwords, network connections, and so on.
